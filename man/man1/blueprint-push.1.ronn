blueprint-push(1) -- push a blueprint to the Internet
=====================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`blueprint push` [`-q`] _name_  

## DESCRIPTION

`blueprint-push` stores the blueprint _name_ and all associated tarballs as _name_ on the configured server (which is `https://devstructure.com` by default) and prints the URL from which it may be fetched.

If no _secret_ is configured in `/etc/blueprint-io.cfg` or `~/.blueprint-io.cfg`, one is created and a sample configuration is printed.

## OPTIONS

* `-q`, `--quiet`:
  Operate quietly.
* `-h`, `--help`:
  Show a help message.

## FILES

* `~/.blueprints.git`:
  The local repsitory where blueprints are stored, each on its own branch.
* `/etc/blueprint-io.cfg`, `~/.blueprint-io.cfg`:
  Optional INI-style configuration files for specifying a `server` and `secret` value.

## EXAMPLES

Example `~/.blueprint-io.cfg`:

	[default]
	server = https://devstructure.com
	secret = 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_-

The _server_ in this case specifies the default and may be omitted.
